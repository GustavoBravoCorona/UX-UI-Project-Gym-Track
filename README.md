# UX-UI-Project-Gym-Track

Adobe XD Prototype

Gym Track is a UX/UI project that I created where it allows gym-goers to interact with their workout plans. Instead of relying on paper, users can access their workouts directly on their phone, track exercises, sets, and progress, and stay focused during training. The project emphasizes usability, simplicity, and efficiency to create a seamless in-gym experience. Click the link and try it yourself.
